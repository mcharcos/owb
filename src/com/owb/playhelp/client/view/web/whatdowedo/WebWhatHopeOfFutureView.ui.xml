				All children must have a way 
    		    out of thieving, begging or being completely abandoned when they become adults.
				In addition to helping children as they are growing it is important to give them
				a path which will help them when adults. Projects should encourages the children to envision their future and 
    		    professions, to help them providing the education and guidance to allow them 
    		    achieve their dreams. We encourage projects that provide aplan to children independently of 
    		    their dreams for after their childhood.
