						We work with organizations and orphanages that start projects matching our standards. 
						We support them and represent them in the community and within our network if they follow 
						the standards in any of the areas they are trying to help. We guaranty that the projects
						that we support work toward the goals we defined for each of these areas. These goals
						were defined as a reference that we believe is ideal to allow children grow in an appropriate environment
						that help them build their future as deserved by any human being. Although we are aware that
						these goals are challenging and utopique, we believe that having them as a reference
						will help to always know the way our efforts must go.
