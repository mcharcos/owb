		It encourages children to go to the school and provides guidance with 
    		    homework and questions about intellectual, emotional or any other doubt during their childhood. 
    		    As most of the parents would do for their children, it should aim to help them 
    		    so they have good scores and over all learn the basic knowledge to survive in their society.
