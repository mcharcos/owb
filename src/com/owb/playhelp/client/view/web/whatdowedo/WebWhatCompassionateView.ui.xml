		It should build a compassionate environment 
    		    between the children and with respect to the staff and volunteers. In addition, 
    		    helping others is an important teaching from life since it helps to overcome our 
    		    egos. This is part of many religion and society rules. Children must participate 
    		    in outside volunteer opportunities and have a volunteering project that will 
    		    reinforce the community feeling part of their own big family.
