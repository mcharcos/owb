	    <h1>DISCIPLINE</h1>
		Discipline is a required part for a human to live in any society. 
    		    Rules must be clear and oriented according to the standards. 
                Children should have guidance during play and education moments. They must have 
                an external authority that make them follow the rules without any abuse or hard 
                authority. We assume that it is the responsibility of the care takers that all 
                these points are follow. Of course, it could happen that the children do not 
                contribute or feel enthusiastic about their responsibilities in particular when 
                there is a long history of bad habits.
