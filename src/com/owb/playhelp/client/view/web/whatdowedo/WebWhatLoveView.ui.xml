    		    parent would do with their own children. The children should feel every day that 
    		    they can count on someone that spend part of their time with them. It provides 
    		    the love to overcome the impact of not having their parents close and a reference 
    		    for them to be able to love others. It should supply staff or external 
    		    people and should train care givers to overcome the extensive work of the 
    		    shelter in order to provide enough love to the children.
