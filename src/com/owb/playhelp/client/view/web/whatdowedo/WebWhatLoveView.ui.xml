				Love is an important part of children and adults. It is clear the importance
				of being valued in our society and others. We should provide to abandoned and orphan children 
				the sense of care as a 
    		    parent would do with their own children. The children should feel every day that 
    		    they can count on someone that spend part of their time with them. Projects should provide 
    		    the love to overcome the impact of not having their parents close and a reference 
    		    for them to be able to love others. They should supply staff or external 
    		    people and should train care givers to overcome the extensive work of the 
    		    shelter in order to provide enough love to the children.
