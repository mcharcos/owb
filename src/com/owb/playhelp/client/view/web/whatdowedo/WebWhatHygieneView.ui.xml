				We support projects that aim to provide the resources and areas that are related to 
				hygiene and educate the children about its importance.
				Ideally a shelter should provide a bathroom with shower, sink and toilet that must be clean 
    		    at any time, a place to clean cloths and it is essential that all areas 
    		    are clean including mattresses, rooms and kitchen. As an 
    		    educational exercise we should encourage children to participate in 
    		    daily cleaning tasks. This mustnâ€™t me done as a way to reduce expenses for 
    		    cleaning purposes but as good parents do with their own children to teach them 
    		    the sense of responsibility and community.
