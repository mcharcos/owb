		It should make the children involved with the daily tasks
    		    as a way of teaching the sense of responsibility and social 
    		    obligations. These tasks are intended to make the children feel part of a big 
    		    family by being willing to improve their conditions and the place. Responsibilities 
    		    include cleaning and taking care of their younger sister and brothers.
