				One important area to understand our role in our society and being able to live in harmony with 
				others is the sense of responsability toward our community. In order to give them the opportunity
				of social integration and responsability, we should make the children involved with the daily tasks
    		    as a way of teaching the sense of responsibility and social 
    		    obligations. These tasks are intended to make the children feel part of a big 
    		    family by being willing to improve their conditions and the place. Responsibilities 
    		    include cleaning and taking care of their younger sister and brothers.
