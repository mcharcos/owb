		<h1>WHAT DO WE DO?</h1>
	    We envision to certify that projects in our network work toward providing children
	    the quality of life. It is important for the children to reach 
	    a minimum standard in each area in order to allow them to grow and build 
	    their future as deserve by any human being. We provide support in the areas of health, 
	    education, food, shelter, clothing, hygiene, joy, hope of future, love, responsibilities, 
	    safety, guidance, compassionate atmosphere and discipline. Projects of the OWB network 
	    engage to follow the standards of these areas as follow:

  		<UL TYPE="SQUARE">
  			<li><b>Health</b>: It provides medical care when children suffer of disease or get hurt. 
  			    It also teach the children the importance of a healthy diet and physical exercise. 
  			    For instance, physical exercise should be encouraged and frequently practiced allowing children 
  			    to develop their favorite sport in the limits of availability.</li>
    		<li><b>Education</b>: It encourages children to go to the school and provides guidance with 
    		    homework and questions about intellectual, emotional or any other doubt during their childhood. 
    		    As most of the parents would do for their children, it should aim to help them 
    		    so they have good scores and over all learn the basic knowledge to survive in their society.</li>
    		<li><b>Food</b>: It provides three healthy meals a day or at least the average nutrients 
    		    and food of the population in its country. Variety and international menus are 
    		    encourage even though we understand that most of the times the situation is not 
    		    easy.</li>
    		<li><b>Shelter</b>: It hosts the children inside a protected shelter. Likely, the place would be a safe 
    		    building but in emergency situations such a disasters or extreme poverty the place 
    		    could be more temporary homes protecting the children. The place should contain 
    		    different areas for playing, doing homework, cooking and sleeping. These areas 
    		    should have the minimum material and space to perform the associated task. 
    		    For example, the bedroom should contain mattresses or any other furniture 
    		    appropriate to the country providing a good rest to the children.</li>
    		<li><b>Clothing</b>: It provides cloths to the children for daily life, school and 
    		    special occasions. It is responsible of changing their cloths and/or shoes at 
    		    least once a week and keeping them clean. It also teach the children how to take 
    		    care of their own cloths and look.</li>
    		<li><b>Hygiene</b>: It has a bathroom with shower, sink and toilet that must be clean 
    		    at any time. It also has a place to clean cloths. It is essential that all areas 
    		    are clean including mattresses, rooms and kitchen. As an 
    		    educational exercise it should encourage children to participate in 
    		    daily cleaning tasks. This mustnâ€™t me done as a way to reduce expenses for 
    		    cleaning purposes but as good parents do with their own children to teach them 
    		    the sense of responsibility and community</li>
    		<li><b>Joy</b>: It reserves time for the children to play alone and in group. 
    		    It encourages social games and good relationship between children to increase 
    		    the sense of family. The games should happen in an safe environment with the 
    		    surveillance of an appropriate number of adults which are encouraged to participate 
    		    and cheer them. The games should be adapted in order to make all children 
    		    participating independently of personal issues such diseases or handicaps.</li>
    		<li><b>Hope of future</b>: It encourages the children to envision their future and 
    		    professions. It helps them providing the education and guidance to allow them 
    		    achieve their dreams. It also has a plan for all the children independently of 
    		    their dreams for after their childhood. All children must have a way 
    		    out of thieving, begging or being completely abandoned when they become adults.</li>
    		<li><b>Love</b>: Its staff or external adults should provide the sense of care as a 
    		    parent would do with their own children. The children should feel every day that 
    		    they can count on someone that spend part of their time with them. It provides 
    		    the love to overcome the impact of not having their parents close and a reference 
    		    for them to be able to love others. It should supply staff or external 
    		    people and should train care givers to overcome the extensive work of the 
    		    shelter in order to provide enough love to the children.</li>
    		<li><b>Responsibilities</b>: It should make the children involved with the daily tasks
    		    as a way of teaching the sense of responsibility and social 
    		    obligations. These tasks are intended to make the children feel part of a big 
    		    family by being willing to improve their conditions and the place. Responsibilities 
    		    include cleaning and taking care of their younger sister and brothers.</li>
    		<li><b>Safety</b>: It should guaranty that all activities happen in a safe environment 
    		    exempt of accidents, fights, abuse any bulling. Safety include conducts between 
    		    children and with respect to the staff and outsider volunteers. It should avoid 
    		    dangerous situations like cutting objects or neglected places or situations and 
    		    provide a plan for caring of the children in case of accidents. It 
    		    must be like a refuge to children from the outside world. Any discrimination, 
    		    sexual and physical abuse of any kind must not be tolerated.</li>
    		<li><b>Guidance</b>: It should provide a mentor or people that can advice the children 
    		    while they are growing. These people should pay close attention to how they conduct, 
    		    encouraging them to do the right things by being an example. These people could be 
    		    staff or outside volunteers. All the conditions of health, safety, 
    		    responsibilities, shelter, food, hygiene, joy,  compassionate environment, 
    		    guidance and discipline also apply to the staff and volunteers.</li>
    		<li><b>Compassionate environment</b>: It should build a compassionate environment 
    		    between the children and with respect to the staff and volunteers. In addition, 
    		    helping others is an important teaching from life since it helps to overcome our 
    		    egos. This is part of many religion and society rules. Children must participate 
    		    in outside volunteer opportunities and have a volunteering project that will 
    		    reinforce the community feeling part of their own big family.</li>
    		<li><b>Discipline</b>: Discipline is a required part for a human to live in any society. 
    		    Rules must be clear and oriented according to the standards. 
                Children should have guidance during play and education moments. They must have 
                an external authority that make them follow the rules without any abuse or hard 
                authority. We assume that it is the responsibility of the care takers that all 
                these points are follow. Of course, it could happen that the children do not 
                contribute or feel enthusiastic about their responsibilities in particular when 
                there is a long history of bad habits.</li>
