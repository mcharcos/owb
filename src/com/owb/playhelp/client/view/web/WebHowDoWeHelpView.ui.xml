				Our view is to unified effords and take advantage of the different expertise to provide a better life to abandoned

				The difference will happen when we are able to listen what are the real needs of the <b>children</b> and focus the <b>projects</b>
				that help them in order to achieve the change. This will not be possible without the experience in various areas
				of <b>organizations</b> with many years of experience in the field and countries that can provide resources. It will not
				be possible either without the power of <b>individuals</b> that are in touch with their community and are willing to help
				with their ideas.
