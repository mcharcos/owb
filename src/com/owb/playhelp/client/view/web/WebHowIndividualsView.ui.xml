	    <h1>HOW DO WE HELP INDIVIDUALS?</h1>
		Individuals that want to help children in need have here the opportunity to inspire organizations with
		their ideas of how we can make the efforts more efficient and to support the organizations by organizing 
		local efforts in their communities.<br></br><br></br>
		
		They are an important piece of the network because they provide the enthusiasm, ideas, volunteer support, find the resources within our community (town) and awareness. They are the head in our community and face the people in our daily life to raise awareness and enlighten their hearts.<br></br>
        If you would like to help volunteering in any way go to “Volunteer opportunities”<br></br>
