	    <h1>HOW DO WE HELP PROJECTS?</h1>
		Projects that were started by individuals, small groups and large organizations in order to helping children 
		are the main bone to improve their life. Specific projects devoted to help in one of the areas we identified
		in our proect are at the forefront of our work. We represent them to finding resources, connecting to other organizations or
		find other people in different parts of the world that can support them with ideas, resources or raising awareness. We 
		promote creation of small projects helping children and find resources for them or stimulate help in developed countries.
        Through our network of organizations or within our community we find advice on how to proceed with projects, find resources
        or be more efficient. If you think you have a project join us as a project by clicking on 
        "Contact Us>>Share Your Project Needs".<br></br>
