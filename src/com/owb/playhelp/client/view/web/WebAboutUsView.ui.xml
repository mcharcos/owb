	    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
	    Orphanage Without Borders is a volunteer organization aiming to create an impact in the life
	    of children. Our purpose is to facilitate connections between orphanages and projects
	    helping children in order to respond to their needs. We intend to use the existing resources
	    and the power of organizations that already exist to help in specific areas. We believe
	    that collaboration is the key to improve the life of depracated children and that the knowledge 
	    of existing resources is an enourmous asset to make help more efficient.<br></br>
