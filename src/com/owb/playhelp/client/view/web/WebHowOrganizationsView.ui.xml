				Organizations that work in specific areas have the experience to support projects with their expertise. Creating a network
				that can provide knowledge and resources is critical to achieve our goal. We believe that this network will help not only
				the projects that directly help children but also organizations in different areas to learn from different experiences
				and a framework to find useful information. In addition, the organizations in our network can take advantage of 
				feedback from our community of individuals to find resources and support for their own ongoing projects. We also
				support their projects if they are within our baseline in the areas they work with. 
				If you as an organization like our way to work, join us as an organization by clicking on 
		        "Contact Us>>Join Our Network"
