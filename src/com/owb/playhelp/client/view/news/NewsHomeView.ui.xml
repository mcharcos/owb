	    <h1>ABOUT US</h1>
	    Orphanage Without Borders is a volunteer organization aiming to create an impact in the life
	    of children. Our purpose is to facilitate connections between orphanages and projects
	    helping children in order to respond to their needs. We intend to use the existing resources
	    and the power of organizations that already exist to help in specific areas. We believe
	    that collaboration is the key to improve the life of depracated children and that the knowledge 
	    of existing resources is an enourmous asset to make help more efficient.<br></br>
	    <br></br><br></br>
	    
	    <h1>DESCRIPTION</h1>
	    Abandoned children are a vulnerable population who experience a difficult life. 
	    The population includes orphan children living in the streets as well as children hosted 
	    in orphanages because either they do not have a family or their families are unable to 
	    provide them care due to extreme poverty or other reasons. The number of abandoned 
	    children is increasing worldwide especially in countries striked by <b>poverty</b>, 
	    <b>conflicts</b>, <b>diseases</b> and <b>disasters</b> where the mortality increases
	    as well as their chances of becoming orphans. <br></br>
	    <br></br><br></br>
	    
	    <b>Poverty</b> is the main reason of having a high number of the children in orphanages. 
	    Most of the children in orphanages have not lost their parents but their families do 
	    not afford to raise them. For example, many children born during Ceausescu’s 
	    anti-abortion law were placed in orphanages. According to the Save the Children reports, 
	    an average of 80% of the children in orphanages are put in orphanages due to poverty. 
	    In Ghana, Indonesia and countries in eastern Europe this percentage is even higher: 90%.<br></br>
	    <br></br><br></br>
	    
	    Countries involved in <b>war</b> also have a high number of orphans such as Afghanistan that 
	    has one and half million orphans. Based on Unicef report, “During the last decade, 
	    2 million children worldwide have been killed as a result of war, four to five million 
	    children have been disabled, 12 million have been left homeless, more than one million 
	    orphaned or separated from their parents, and approximately ten million children have 
	    been psychologically traumatized as a result of war (UNICEF's The State of World's 
	    Children 1996)”.<br></br>
	    <br></br><br></br>
	    
	    Epidemic <b>diseases</b> such as HIV are another reason for the increased number of orphans 
	    who in addition are likely to host these diseases. For instance, South Africa, with the 
	    rate of 70,000 a year, has the highest number of orphans with HIV whose parents have 
	    died due to AIDS (Time World June 01 2011). In addition, disease outbreaks that happen 
	    in war countries are difficult to eradicate. For example, polio re-emerged in 2005 in 
	    Angola after the civil war and vaccination campaigns were difficult (especially in the 
	    countryside) to pursue when the infrastructures were destroyed.<br></br>
	    <br></br><br></br>
	    
	    Finally, <b>natural or human made disasters</b> increase the number of orphans. For instance, 
	    in Japan and Haiti, a huge number of children lost their parents due to earthquakes. 
	    It is estimated that 1400 children lost at least one parent, around 200 children lost 
	    both earthquake in Japan (Time World July, 10 2011.) and U.S. adopteted 1000 children 
	    from Haiti. The effects of natural disasters are commonly stronger in poor countries 
	    and increase the chances of diseases. <br></br>
	    <br></br><br></br>
	    
	    <h1>OUR DREAM</h1>
	    We envision to certify that projects in our network work toward providing children
	    the quality of life. It is important for the children to reach 
	    a minimum standard in each area in order to allow them to grow and build 
	    their future as deserve by any human being. We provide support in the areas of health, 
	    education, food, shelter, clothing, hygiene, joy, hope of future, love, responsibilities, 
	    safety, guidance, compassionate atmosphere and discipline. Projects of the OWB network 
	    engage to follow the standards of these areas as follow:

  		<UL TYPE="SQUARE">
  			<li><b>Health</b>: It provides medical care when children suffer of disease or get hurt. 
  			    It also teach the children the importance of a healthy diet and physical exercise. 
  			    For instance, physical exercise should be encouraged and frequently practiced allowing children 
  			    to develop their favorite sport in the limits of availability.</li>
    		<li><b>Education</b>: It encourages children to go to the school and provides guidance with 
    		    homework and questions about intellectual, emotional or any other doubt during their childhood. 
    		    As most of the parents would do for their children, it should aim to help them 
    		    so they have good scores and over all learn the basic knowledge to survive in their society.</li>
    		<li><b>Food</b>: It provides three healthy meals a day or at least the average nutrients 
    		    and food of the population in its country. Variety and international menus are 
    		    encourage even though we understand that most of the times the situation is not 
    		    easy.</li>
    		<li><b>Shelter</b>: It hosts the children inside a protected shelter. Likely, the place would be a safe 
    		    building but in emergency situations such a disasters or extreme poverty the place 
    		    could be more temporary homes protecting the children. The place should contain 
    		    different areas for playing, doing homework, cooking and sleeping. These areas 
    		    should have the minimum material and space to perform the associated task. 
    		    For example, the bedroom should contain mattresses or any other furniture 
    		    appropriate to the country providing a good rest to the children.</li>
    		<li><b>Clothing</b>: It provides cloths to the children for daily life, school and 
    		    special occasions. It is responsible of changing their cloths and/or shoes at 
    		    least once a week and keeping them clean. It also teach the children how to take 
    		    care of their own cloths and look.</li>
    		<li><b>Hygiene</b>: It has a bathroom with shower, sink and toilet that must be clean 
    		    at any time. It also has a place to clean cloths. It is essential that all areas 
    		    are clean including mattresses, rooms and kitchen. As an 
    		    educational exercise it should encourage children to participate in 
    		    daily cleaning tasks. This mustn’t me done as a way to reduce expenses for 
    		    cleaning purposes but as good parents do with their own children to teach them 
    		    the sense of responsibility and community</li>
    		<li><b>Joy</b>: It reserves time for the children to play alone and in group. 
    		    It encourages social games and good relationship between children to increase 
    		    the sense of family. The games should happen in an safe environment with the 
    		    surveillance of an appropriate number of adults which are encouraged to participate 
    		    and cheer them. The games should be adapted in order to make all children 
    		    participating independently of personal issues such diseases or handicaps.</li>
    		<li><b>Hope of future</b>: It encourages the children to envision their future and 
    		    professions. It helps them providing the education and guidance to allow them 
    		    achieve their dreams. It also has a plan for all the children independently of 
    		    their dreams for after their childhood. All children must have a way 
    		    out of thieving, begging or being completely abandoned when they become adults.</li>
    		<li><b>Love</b>: Its staff or external adults should provide the sense of care as a 
    		    parent would do with their own children. The children should feel every day that 
    		    they can count on someone that spend part of their time with them. It provides 
    		    the love to overcome the impact of not having their parents close and a reference 
    		    for them to be able to love others. It should supply staff or external 
    		    people and should train care givers to overcome the extensive work of the 
    		    shelter in order to provide enough love to the children.</li>
    		<li><b>Responsibilities</b>: It should make the children involved with the daily tasks
    		    as a way of teaching the sense of responsibility and social 
    		    obligations. These tasks are intended to make the children feel part of a big 
    		    family by being willing to improve their conditions and the place. Responsibilities 
    		    include cleaning and taking care of their younger sister and brothers.</li>
    		<li><b>Safety</b>: It should guaranty that all activities happen in a safe environment 
    		    exempt of accidents, fights, abuse any bulling. Safety include conducts between 
    		    children and with respect to the staff and outsider volunteers. It should avoid 
    		    dangerous situations like cutting objects or neglected places or situations and 
    		    provide a plan for caring of the children in case of accidents. It 
    		    must be like a refuge to children from the outside world. Any discrimination, 
    		    sexual and physical abuse of any kind must not be tolerated.</li>
    		<li><b>Guidance</b>: It should provide a mentor or people that can advice the children 
    		    while they are growing. These people should pay close attention to how they conduct, 
    		    encouraging them to do the right things by being an example. These people could be 
    		    staff or outside volunteers. All the conditions of health, safety, 
    		    responsibilities, shelter, food, hygiene, joy,  compassionate environment, 
    		    guidance and discipline also apply to the staff and volunteers.</li>
    		<li><b>Compassionate environment</b>: It should build a compassionate environment 
    		    between the children and with respect to the staff and volunteers. In addition, 
    		    helping others is an important teaching from life since it helps to overcome our 
    		    egos. This is part of many religion and society rules. Children must participate 
    		    in outside volunteer opportunities and have a volunteering project that will 
    		    reinforce the community feeling part of their own big family.</li>
    		<li><b>Discipline</b>: Discipline is a required part for a human to live in any society. 
    		    Rules must be clear and oriented according to the standards. 
                Children should have guidance during play and education moments. They must have 
                an external authority that make them follow the rules without any abuse or hard 
                authority. We assume that it is the responsibility of the care takers that all 
                these points are follow. Of course, it could happen that the children do not 
                contribute or feel enthusiastic about their responsibilities in particular when 
                there is a long history of bad habits.</li>

	    <h1>OUR VIEW</h1>
	    Our ultimate goal is to being able to provide the minimum standards for each of the
	    different areas for orphans and abandoned children all around the world. 
	    For this purpose, we believe that we have also responsibilities toward orphanages, 
	    donors, organizations and volunteers participating to this ambitious project. 
	    Therefore, it is also part of our goals building a good relationship within these four 
	    partners, make communication clear and develop common respect. Our goals include the 
	    need to provide this environment in order to empower our efforts toward helping the 
	    conditions of children.

  		<UL TYPE="SQUARE">
  			<li><b>Union</b>: Many efforts exist around the world providing good support in 
  			       different areas. We engage to coordinate these efforts and 
  			       provide an infrastructure allowing these different organizations close 
  			       collaboration. We will also provide a common gate for organizations and 
  			       individuals willing to help the cause.</li>
    		<li><b>Recycle Efforts</b>: We are responsible of using the current efforts for 
    		       helping orphan and abandoned children to reach resources including funding, 
    		       volunteers and training. We do not intend to create a new organization 
    		       helping directly to the cause but helping to bring forward the work of those 
    		       organizations that are already involved directly with the orphanages or other 
    		       activities helping children. We engage to empower their efforts.</li>
    		<li><b>Clear Communication</b>:  We are responsible of surveying the projects and 
    		       facilitating the communication between the organizations and individuals 
    		       through our network contributing to helping children. Information about 
    		       the status and needs of the projects will be frequent and clear. This will 
    		       guaranty that the standards of each project are follow and people know at 
    		       any time the status of their investments. Also, our infrastructure will 
    		       facilitate the people providing resources such as money or time to decide in 
    		       what specific project and activity they want to help. For example, donors 
    		       should be able to decide  to the detail of funding to a health activity 
    		       such as buying new drugs for an orphanage.</li>
    		<li><b>Learning from Experience</b>: We aim to create an infrastructure allowing 
    		       projects to learn from previous and current projects. Therefore, non-confidential 
    		       information have to be available and organized to increase the efficiency of 
    		       the projects. We engage to provide tools to the collaborators of each project 
    		       in order to share information and avoiding repeating the same efforts.</li>
    		<li><b>Facilitate Help</b>: We engage to build an infrastructure were people can 
    		       easily provide their help. This will be perform by taking advantage of the 
    		       current technological advances and bringing them to the organizations, 
    		       individuals and orphanages. In addition, we will facilitate volunteer 
    		       opportunities with a minimum expenses. </li>
    		<li><b>Community Involvement</b>: This experience should be not only a way to improve 
    		       the quality of life of orphan children but also an example to all involved people 
    		       as donors, volunteers and staff. We can learn the basic 
    		       and good principles by focusing on children that have much to teach us and 
    		       paying attention to the important needs of a human being. We engage to involve 
    		       the children in project and to provide feedback of their opinions and feelings 
    		       to the community.</li>
    		<li><b>General Involvement</b>: We aim to involve as many people as possible to help 
    		       to the cause. For this purpose, it is also part of our involvement to bring the 
    		       problem of orphan and abandoned children needs to the community. We engage to broadcast the need for 
    		       helping these children and provide tasks to the community helping for the cause 
    		       and adapted to each group we are trying to reach to such as schools. 
    		       Thus, outreach is part of our goals.</li>
    		<li><b>Contributor Recognition</b>: Social recognition is an important source of 
    		       motivation for contributors. We will provide an infrastructure that will 
    		       facilitate social network recognition and awards to volunteers, donors, 
    		       organizations and orphanages for their contribution or their good work and 
    		       participation. </li>

	    <h1>OUR WAY</h1>
	    Orphanage Without Borders provides a common portal for organization and individuals to 
	    unify their efforts and facilitate contributions to the cause of abandoned children. This site 
	    allows projects of our network to inform about the specific needs for reaching the 
	    acceptable standards of child's lifes. They are also able to create the necessary projects that will walk 
	    them through the path to follow the standards. Through our portal, individuals and 
	    organizations know about child's needs, projects and their status. 
	    This information is critical for participants that are able to decide 
	    in detail how their contribution is used and know how their volunteer actions will make 
	    a difference. It is also important for nonprofits willing to help to the cause in their 
	    specific area. Therefore, our portal creates a network connecting orphanages with 
	    organizations, individuals and nonprofits with different expertise. A collaborative 
	    environment results in a more efficient support and increases the confidence of people 
	    participating to the cause. In addition, we hope our portal will be a site to share 
	    knowledge that allows new projects to learn from previous experience. Moreover, it will 
	    be a practical source of information for volunteers and organizations. We intend to use 
	    the resources in each area provided by existing organizations to support existing 
	    projects. However, Orphanage Without Borders will provide training, supervision and 
	    <br></br><br></br>
			    
	    Our organization provides the technoligical tools, consultancy and expertise to support 
	    activities toward these goals in each of these areas. Our portalis a visual 
	    development solution for organizations and projects to increase contributions from 
	    individuals and support improving the standards of life of children around the world 
	    by addressing the current issues:

  		<UL TYPE="SQUARE">
  			<li>Joining efforts and resources to take advantage of previous experiences</li>
  			<li>Motivating collaboration against competition</li>
  			<li>Informing more contributors about the status of the projects</li>
  			<li>Allowing contributors to make decision on how their help is used</li>
  			<li>Rewarding contributors to motivate more collaboration</li>
  			<li>Creating a strong network of resources working together on the common objective of improving the life quality of orphaned and abandoned children.</li>
  			<li>Creating a network of volunteers, motivate people to participate in the program and facilitate their experience</li>
  			<li>Improving the relationship and links between donors, non-profit organizations and volunteers.</li>
  			<li>Increasing the help to orphaned and abandoned children</li>
  			<li>Increasing the flow of information about the cause</li>
  			<li>Visually representing the status and the resources for everyone who wants to change the situation.</li>
